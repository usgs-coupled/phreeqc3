<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-476704"></A>After reading a database file of thermodynamic data, PHREEQC reads an input file until it reaches an <A HREF="phreeqc3-12.htm#50462721_63178" CLASS="XRef">END</A> keyword or the end of the file. At that point, PHREEQC begins a simulation by processing any new thermodynamic data that have been read, creating updated lists of elements, phases, and aqueous, exchange, and surface species. After processing these new data, up to 12 types of calculations or data management operations may be performed in the following order: (1) initial solution or speciation calculations, (2) initial exchange calculations, (3) initial surface calculations, (4) initial gas-phase calculations, (5) batch-reaction calculations, (6) inverse-modeling calculations, (7) advective-transport calculations, (8) advective- dispersive transport calculations, (9) cell batch-reaction calculations, (10) copy operations, (11) dump operations, and (12) delete operations. After all of these calculations and operations are completed, PHREEQC reads the input file to the next <A HREF="phreeqc3-12.htm#50462721_63178" CLASS="XRef">END</A> keyword and starts another simulation.

<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-468922"></A>Generally, a chemical analysis provides total concentrations of elements in solution. A speciation calculation distributes these totals among aqueous species by using an aqueous model; the results of the speciation calculation are the activities of all of the aqueous species. The activities can be used for calculating saturation indices for minerals, relative to the water. Speciation modeling requires only a <A HREF="phreeqc3-41.htm#50462721_30253" CLASS="XRef">SOLUTION</A> data block for each water analysis for which saturation indices are to be calculated. Alternatively, the <A HREF="phreeqc3-44.htm#50462721_84297" CLASS="XRef">SOLUTION_SPREAD</A> data block can be used to define multiple solutions in the same data block--one row for each solution--and speciation calculations are performed for each analysis. <A HREF="phreeqc3-56.htm#50462735_24208" CLASS="XRef">Example 1</A> demonstrates speciation calculations.</P>

<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-481916"></A>One type of reactant used by PHREEQC is an assemblage of one or more ion exchangers. The elemental composition of the exchange assemblage can be defined explicitly or implicitly with the <A HREF="phreeqc3-14.htm#50462721_84573" CLASS="XRef">EXCHANGE</A> data block. If the composition is defined explicitly, that is by specifying the number of moles of each element on exchange sites, then there is no need for an initial exchange calculation. If the composition of the exchange assemblage is defined implicitly, a calculation is performed to determine the composition of the exchanger that is in equilibrium with a specified solution composition. In this calculation, the composition of the solution does not change, but the composition of the exchanger is adjusted until it is in equilibrium with the solution.

<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-931450"></A>A gas phase is defined by the number of moles of gas components that are present. The gas phase may have either constant pressure or constant volume. The number of moles of each component in a constant-pressure gas phase can be defined by specifying the partial pressures of all the gas components, in which case no initial gas-phase calculation is done. An initial gas-phase calculation is done when the identifier -equilibrate is included in a fixed-volume gas-phase definition. In this case, the partial pressure of each gas component in the solution is taken as the partial pressure in the gas phase. From the partial pressures and the volume of the gas phase, the moles of each component will be calculated by the ideal gas law or (approximately) with the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The composition of the solution is not changed during an initial gas-phase calculation.

<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-935428"></A>Batch-reaction calculations simulate reactions occurring in a beaker and can involve equilibrium and irreversible reactions. Equilibrium reactions are defined by specifying a solution or mixture of solutions to be put in the beaker along with a pure-phase assemblage, an exchange assemblage, a multicomponent gas phase, a solid-solution assemblage, and (or) a surface assemblage. The solution or mixture is brought to equilibrium with the reactants. Furthermore, irreversible reactions can be specified, including addition or removal of specified reactants, pressure changes, temperature changes, and (or) kinetic reactions, where the reaction rate can depend on solution composition or other, user-definable parameters.

<A NAME="50462727_pgfId-488790"></A>Cell batch-reaction calculations are a special case of batch-reaction calculations. Whereas any reactant with any identification number can be reacted in a batch-reaction calculation, only reactants with the same identification number are used in a cell batch-reaction calculation. For a cell batch-reaction calculation, the identification number (cell number) is specified, and any reactants with that identification number are brought together and reacted. The reactants may include any defined by the <A HREF="phreeqc3-13.htm#50462721_61207" CLASS="XRef">EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-14.htm#50462721_84573" CLASS="XRef">EXCHANGE</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-17.htm#50462721_83409" CLASS="XRef">GAS_PHASE</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-24.htm#50462721_55637" CLASS="XRef">KINETICS</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-27.htm#50462721_23725" CLASS="XRef">MIX</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-33.htm#50462721_75635" CLASS="XRef">REACTION</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-34.htm#50462721_65966" CLASS="XRef">REACTION_PRESSURE</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-35.htm#50462721_75016" CLASS="XRef">REACTION_TEMPERATURE</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-40.htm#50462721_77444" CLASS="XRef">SOLID_SOLUTIONS</A>, <A HREF="phreeqc3-41.htm#50462721_30253" CLASS="XRef">SOLUTION</A>, and <A HREF="phreeqc3-45.htm#50462721_56392" CLASS="XRef">SURFACE</A> data blocks.
